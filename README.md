Senior research project for CHEM 499 & CHEM 399 at California State University San Marcos. 

## Project Description
In order to analyze FASTA files of bacterial transmembrane proteins, a command line tool was developed in Python for parsing FASTA files with specific segment parameters listed in the description line of the file. 

## Research Summary
Hydrophobicity (transfer energy, Î”G) and hydrophobic moment calculations were needed for each segment to better understand how segments of transmembrane proteins are introduced into the membrane by the translocon. Current literature states that this decision is made based on the hydrophobicity of the segment.
